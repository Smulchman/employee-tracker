## Description

This is a simple app executed through the console to retrieve and create data points stored in a SQL database based on user input.\
Please note: this app is not yet completed.

## Usage

You can view a video of the app in use [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QCzaLrW0CPDRfpe2dGC--JA9VfFyALM5/view) \

To use this app, you need to download the repository to your local machine.\
Then use npm i to initialize the node modules required.\
After doing so, if you type 'node index' into your console while in the folder of this repo, you will be given a series of prompts.\
The prompts will allow you to navigate the app and give you options to create or retrieve data from a connected SQL database built as an employee tracker.\
Follow the prompts for as long as you desire and, when you have completed your interactions with the database, use cntrl+c to end the current instance of the terminal. If you do not do this step it will run forever.
